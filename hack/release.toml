        description = """\
In addition to (default) `RollingUpdate` rollout strategy CACCPT now supports
`OnDelete` rollout strategy which basically disables automatic rollout of updated

        title = "Fallback to External IPs"
        description = """\
The control plane provider now falls back to external IPs if the internal IPs are not available for Talos bootstrapping.

This provides compatibility with some infrastructure providers that do not support internal IPs.
